 *
 * This application sends an HTTPS request to os.mbed.com and searches
 * for a string in the result.
 *
 * This example is implemented as a logic class (HelloHttpsClient) wrapping a
 * TCP socket. The logic class handles all events, leaving the main loop to just
 * check if the process  has finished.
