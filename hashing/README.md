# SHA-256 Hash example on Mbed OS

This application performs hashing of a buffer with SHA-256 using various APIs. It serves as a tutorial for the basic hashing APIs of Mbed TLS.

## Getting started

Set up your environment if you have not done so already. For instructions, refer to the [main readme](../README.md).

You can also compile this example with the [Mbed Online Compiler](https://os.mbed.com/compiler/) by using [this project](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-tls-hashing).

## Monitoring the application

The output in the terminal window should be similar to this:

```
Method 1: 315f5bdb76d078c43b8ac0064e4a0164612b1fce77c869345bfc94c75894edd3
